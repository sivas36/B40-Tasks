HTTP/1.1    

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it

It works on the textual format.    

There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

It compresses data by itself

HTTP/2

HTTP/2, however, multiplexes streams within a single TCP connection, and will have to implement flow control in a different manner.

It works on the binary protocol.

It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

It uses HPACK for data compression.
